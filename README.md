# Employee Data Dashboard 
Employee Data Dashboard ðŸ“Š is a dynamic and interactive web application built using Streamlit, Pandas, and Matplotlib, designed to help HR professionals, managers, or data enthusiasts explore and visualize employee data effortlessly. The dashboard provides a user-friendly interface where users can upload Excel or CSV files containing employee information and immediately gain insights through interactive visualizations and data summaries.  The application automatically detects key columns such as Salary, Department, Age, Experience, and Performance, making it highly flexible with different datasets. Upon uploading, the dashboard performs essential data cleaning steps, including filling missing salary values with the average, replacing missing department entries with "Unknown", and removing duplicate rows. It also calculates a bonus field, set as 10% of each employeeâ€™s salary, and classifies employees into experience levelsâ€”Junior, Mid, or Seniorâ€”based on their years of experience.
